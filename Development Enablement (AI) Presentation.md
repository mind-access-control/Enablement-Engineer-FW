# From PO/SM to AI-Powered Development Enablement

## The Evolved Role

- **Beyond Management:** We are not just managing tasks and sprints; we are actively enabling and accelerating development with AI.
- **Our Goal:** To integrate AI tools into every phase of the product lifecycle to maximize efficiency and value.

## The AI-Powered Process

- **Requirements:** From manual notes to detailed user stories generated by **Gemini** .
- **Prototyping:** From static wireframes to functional proof-of-concepts with **V0** .
- **Development:** From a blank slate to a head-start with **Cursor** .
- **Quality Assurance:** From reactive testing to automated, proactive quality checks with **Cypress** and **Copilot** .
- **Documentation:** From a post-launch chore to an automated, integrated part of the process.

## Phase 1: Requirements to Prototype

- **Capture & Define:** Use **Gemini** to transcribe and synthesize meeting notes, generating a complete requirements document and user stories.
- **Prompting Magic:** Craft precise prompts with AI assistance, specifying tech stack ( **React** , **Tailwind** ), architecture (component-based), and design principles (mobile-first).
- **Prototype & Validate:** Generate a functional prototype using **V0** , get immediate feedback, and iterate quickly.

## Phase 2: Development to Deployment

- **Local Setup:** Use **Cursor** to make the V0 code runnable locally, and add functional mocked data.
- **Code Versioning:** Push the project to **GitHub** .
- **Live Demo:** Automatically deploy the code from GitHub to a live URL using **Netlify** .
- **Iterate:** Use client feedback to quickly improve the demo, repeating the AI-assisted prototyping loop as needed.

## Phase 3: Finalizing with AI

- **Documentation:** Use **Cursor** to automatically generate setup guides, project architecture documentation, and user manuals.
- **Backend & DB:** Build out the backend and connect to a database like **Supabase** , requesting AI assistance one feature at a time to ensure quality.
- **Test Automation:** Use **Cypress** with **Copilot** to generate automated tests for your front-end and backend, ensuring quality and preventing regression.

## The Future is Now

- **Our Mindset:** We are the catalysts for development, not just the managers.
- **Key takeaway:** This process is a framework, a starting point. Embrace the tools and adapt them to your unique challenges. The goal is always the same: to deliver value faster and with higher quality.
